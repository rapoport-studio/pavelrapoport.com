/**
 * PivotAct — third and concluding act of the About section. The thesis:
 * the 2026 turn from hand-written code to OpenSpec authorship.
 *
 * Editorial treatment is louder than the other two acts on purpose —
 * Pivot is the section's argument peak, not just another paragraph:
 *
 *   - Headline at text-4xl/md:text-5xl (vs Origin's text-2xl/3xl), in
 *     `text-accent-current` (the green "now" token). This echoes the
 *     Own-Studio square in the strip above and Own-Studio's accent
 *     border-left in the list — same color, three places, one through-line.
 *   - A 2px left rule in the same accent-current color spans the full
 *     block. Same visual language as a highlighted period row in the list.
 *   - Body capped at max-w-3xl to match the Career intro's reading width.
 *
 * Strings come from `web.home.about.pivot.*` resolved by AboutSection.
 * Body splits on "\n\n" — the i18n keys are authored as 4 paragraph beats.
