# integrations

> Universal connectors to everything the studio touches.

## Purpose

**What:** Platform-level integration layer. Two concepts:
Integration (driver — "we can talk to Linear") and Connection
(instance — "project X is connected to Linear workspace Y
with this token").

**For whom:** Pavel (configures connections per project),
the system (uses connections to sync data, trigger actions,
track costs), clients and network members (eventually —
connect their own tools).

**Why it exists:** The studio orchestrates many external
services. Each one needs auth, config, status tracking,
and a shared interface. Without a unified integration layer,
every domain reinvents how to talk to the outside world.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Integration Registry

The system SHALL maintain a registry of supported integration
types, each describing the external service capabilities.

#### Scenario: Listing available integrations
- **GIVEN** the integration registry exists
- **WHEN** Pavel opens the integrations settings
- **THEN** he sees all supported types grouped by category:
  AI Models, AI Coding, Dev Platform, Monitoring,
  Communication, Knowledge, Finance

### Requirement: Connection Lifecycle

Each connection SHALL follow a lifecycle:
disconnected → connecting → connected → error.

#### Scenario: Creating a new connection
- **WHEN** Pavel connects a project to a GitHub repo
- **THEN** the system creates a connection with type `github`,
  scope `project`, config (repo slug, token), status `connecting`
- **AND** validates the credentials
- **AND** sets status to `connected` or `error`

#### Scenario: Connection health check
- **GIVEN** a connection with status `connected`
- **WHEN** the system runs a periodic health check
- **THEN** it calls `status()` on the connection
- **AND** updates status and `last_sync` timestamp

### Requirement: Connection Scope

Each connection SHALL have a scope: `global` (platform-wide)
or `project` (belongs to a specific project).

#### Scenario: Global connection
- **WHEN** Pavel connects PostHog for platform analytics
- **THEN** the connection scope is `global`
- **AND** all projects can access this connection

#### Scenario: Project connection
- **WHEN** Pavel connects a GitHub repo to project Dentour
- **THEN** the connection scope is `project`
- **AND** only that project uses this connection

### Requirement: Unified Interface

Every connection SHALL expose a common interface regardless
of the underlying service.

#### Scenario: Common operations
- **GIVEN** any active connection
- **THEN** it supports: `connect()`, `disconnect()`,
  `status()`, `sync()`
- **AND** returns data in a normalized format

### Requirement: Config Management

Connection credentials and configuration SHALL be stored
securely and never exposed in logs or UI.

#### Scenario: Storing credentials
- **WHEN** Pavel enters an API token for a connection
- **THEN** the token is encrypted at rest
- **AND** only the connection type and status are visible in UI

#### Scenario: Key access audit
- **WHEN** any user views, copies, or edits connection credentials
- **THEN** an audit event is logged: user_id, action, connection_id, timestamp, IP
- **AND** organization owners can view the audit log

#### Scenario: Key access notification
- **WHEN** an admin (not owner) accesses connection credentials
- **THEN** the owner receives a notification
- **AND** the audit log records the access

### Requirement: Connection Access Control

The system SHALL restrict connection management by
organization role.

#### Scenario: Connection permissions by role
- **GIVEN** the following access levels:
  - owner: create, read keys, edit, delete, audit — full control
  - admin: create, read keys, edit — audit logged, cannot delete
  - member: use only (system uses keys on their behalf, keys never visible)
  - viewer: no access to connections

#### Scenario: Member uses connection indirectly
- **WHEN** a member performs an action that requires a connection
  (e.g., git push, Linear sync)
- **THEN** the system uses the connection token on their behalf
- **AND** the member never sees the actual credentials

#### Scenario: Connection deletion
- **WHEN** an admin tries to delete a connection
- **THEN** access is denied
- **AND** only organization owners can delete connections

### Requirement: Security Domain Owner

Each organization SHALL have a designated security
responsibility chain.

#### Scenario: Security owner responsibilities
- **GIVEN** the organization owner is the security domain owner
- **THEN** they are responsible for:
  - all connection credentials within the org
  - key rotation schedule
  - reviewing audit logs
  - revoking compromised keys
- **AND** they receive alerts on: connection errors, failed auth,
  unusual access patterns

### Requirement: Supported Integrations

The system SHALL support the following integration types:

**P0 — Core (required for studio to function):**
- Claude API (Opus, Sonnet) — AI model
- Claude Code CLI — code execution
- Linear — task management
- GitHub — code, repos, PRs
- Cloudflare — deployment
- Supabase — database, auth, storage

**P1 — Operations (needed for production use):**
- Sentry — error tracking
- PostHog — analytics, feature flags
- Telegram Bot API — notifications, client entry
- WhatsApp Business API — client communication
- Resend — transactional email

**P2 — Growth (extend capabilities):**
- OpenAI API — multi-model support
- Open-source models (Ollama / Together AI)
- Cursor API — alternative coding agent
- GitHub Copilot — code review assistance
- Vercel — alternative deployment
- Slack API — team communication
- Vector DB (pgvector / Pinecone) — RAG pipelines
- Web Search API — Scout mode research
- Google Drive / Notion — client documents
- Stripe — payments and billing

#### Scenario: Adding a new integration type
- **WHEN** a new service needs to be supported
- **THEN** a new integration driver is added to the registry
- **AND** it implements the unified interface
- **AND** no existing connections are affected

## Entities

- **Integration** — a supported service type (driver).
  Has: type, category, capabilities, auth method, docs URL
- **Connection** — an active link to an external service.
  Has: integration type, scope (global/project), config,
  status, last_sync, project_id (if scoped)
- **SyncEvent** — a record of data exchange through a
  connection. Has: connection_id, direction (in/out),
  payload summary, timestamp, success/error

## Dependencies

- `projects` — project-scoped connections belong to projects
- `auth` — credentials management, access control
- `ai` — AI model connections feed into the agent
- `finance` — API usage costs tracked per connection
